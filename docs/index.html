Vision — Include a vision statement and summary of your project (two-three paragraphs). This is an updated version of the vision from your project proposal.
Team — Include basic information on the team members (one-to-two-sentence descriptions of each, images optional).
Code — Your code base (as appropriate).
Report — For CS/DATA 396, this is the current version of your project proposal, which includes any updates you’ve made to the original proposal. For CS/DATA 398, this is your complete final report.
Also include:
a navigation link to the Department of Computer Science website.
presentation materials from your status report. For CS/DATA 398, include your final presentation.
research papers and other useful materials (as appropriate).
Produce a website that is professional and designed to last beyond the end of the school year.

        <h1>Vision Statement</h1>
        <p>
            My project involves the creation of a brain-computer interface that allows a user to control a drone using motor imagery (imagined body movements). 
            Although the specific task of controlling a drone using neural signals may not seem practical, this way of interfacing with technology is very significant. 
            For individuals that cannot interact with technology in a typical manner (because, for example, they are paralyzed or have limited mobility), 
            a brain-computer interface acts as a new, accessible method for controlling computers since it does not depend on the user’s physical abilities. 
            With this advantage of brain-computer interfaces in mind, I have chosen to utilize motor imagery rather than physical movement to control the drone – 
            so that it could be used by anyone regardless of their motor abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            The core of my solution is a machine learning model that infers drone controls based on the user’s brain activity. 
            I am recording neural signals from an electroencephalography (EEG) cap and have created a pipeline for processing that data so that it can be used as input for the model. 
            The outputs of the model will be commands for how the drone should move. 
        </p>
        <p>
            From the user’s point of view, they will be imagining themselves moving a certain part of their body in order to execute a command on the drone 
            (for example, I could imagine moving my right arm and that could cause the drone to move to the right). This is a control method that has been used for many related works.
            Other ways of using motor imagery to control the drone will be considered throughout the remainder of this project. 
            Using machine learning, I will be able to classify brain activity as matching certain imagined movements.
